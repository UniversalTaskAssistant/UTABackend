Especially when they don't have a way to really unblock your account on your own if your new to it. Garbage.\",\n",
       "  'No cloud backup function available. If you accidentally uninstalled the app, everything will be wiped out including your chat history. The \"migration\" function is there only if you have another device on the same WiFi network to move the record which is stupid and not user friendly at all. Who doesn\\'t have cloud backup nowadays? So outdated. And STOP randomly changing my phone settings including language/font size without my permission!!!',\n",
       "  \"Developers Unresponsive. Didn't use account for a while, forgot password. Account is placed on hold - need a friend to unlock, but feature doesn't work. so, I created a new account. WeChat block the new account as suspicious because it still sees the old account (instead of deleting the old one.) Developers ignore emails. Like everything else made in china: cheap and breaks easily.\",\n",
       "  \"Unusable for me. I cannot sign up because it says Suspicious Registration, I've tried switching phones and contacting the help center. There's no support, they will email you back with a link to their website describing how to sign up when they need to actually help or fix anything. App is garbage and a waste of time. Shame, because I would have liked to keep in contact with my Chinese friends easier.\",\n",
       "  \"The app takes up a ridiculous amount of space. Even with all the cached cleared and images in the app cleared, it takes up nearly 1GB with just the 'App' and the 'Data'. Comparatively, other messenger apps like Facebook's Messenger app only takes like 300-ish MB. It stores copies of all the pictures, voice messages etc deep in your phone as well on top of everything. It's ridiculous how much this app takes over your phone's storage.\",\n",
       "  \"Went in circles trying to transfer history to a new device. Everything else transfered easily (SMS, FB Messenger, WhatsApp, Line) all with ease. This piece of useless fodder takes you in circles. First it tells you to backup via QR code. You scan on the new device and the web address it loads goes no where. Then it recommends doing it via desktop. Again link to no where. If this wasn't my father's preferred way of transferring photos to each other, I wouldn't even have it.\",\n",
       "  \"So frustrating. It was glitching while I was trying to create my account, but I finally got through all the screens after 5 tries. The app let me use it for 2 days before suddenly locking me out because of all the registration attempts!?! The process to unlock the account is absurd. You have to get someone who has used the app for 6 months to 'validate' you. I only had one friend on there and she was 'not qualified.' Absolutely ridiculous. My sister is in China and now she can't check in.\",\n",
       "  'One of the worst messenger apps. Extremely inefficient with management of resources. App setting defaults to automatic download of photos, videos, etc. Even when disabled, there is background download of other files. After clearing all chat history and cache in settings, was still left with over 2GB storage used. Just did a fresh install and already 1.5GB used. Tried to submit feedback in app, unsuccessful. If you have friends that use this, I suppose you are stuck... Or just get new friends.',\n",
       "  'Absolutely horrible app. I downloaded it a while ago and it was working fine until I suddenly got blocked for some having some kind of \"plug-in\" which is completely ridiculous because I haven\\'t downloaded anything. I\\'ve asked multiple friends to try to help verify my account but nothing has worked. Now i can\\'t communicate with Chinese colleagues. Don\\'t use this app.',\n",
       "  \"Because I didn't use this app for 6 months, they shut my app acres. Now I'm trying many times to get back in. Trying to use the option where they send you a code and then when you everyday it the app says it wrong - tries that about ten times. Tried to have a friend follow the app instructions to help verify me and the friend can't see the message that WeChat says is there. Tried to change my password using the email option and they never sent me the email - tried that three times. BAD APP!\",\n",
       "  'Need a different option to activate account! I have a \"suspicious registration\" that I\\'ve been unable to fix because I have to get a friend on WeChat to basically vouch for me. That could work if I knew anyone on there. Kind of hard to even meet anyone on the when you can\\'t even get in for the first time. Useless app. No point in trying again since I\\'ve tried for like 3 months. You guys need more options than \"phone a friend\".',\n",
       "  \"Don't even think about installing this, this app doesn't worth your time. It constantly sends unsolicited user data in the background. I've found out some sensitive user data were sent secretly without obvious breach of ToS. In addition, if I get all of the permissions disabled. It will constantly throw error toasts even when I'm not using the app. Once a while it will open on its own without my consent.\",\n",
       "  \"The app is really spammy & has gone downhill. When I recovered my acct I lost all my messages. I'm close to uninstalling it. I get this obnoxious pop up that randomly comes on my screen multiple times a day to set up my bank account to use their quick pay option. I only have notifications turned on if I receive messages. I don't even run the app in my background, yet the moment I turn on my phone or use another app I randomly get the pop ups. It's their way to coerce me to sign up. Complete BS.\",\n",
       "  \"I love WeChat and use it all the time, both on my Android and my desktop. I have no problems using the desktop app, however I rarely receive notifications on my phone. I have missed several important messages because I didn't know I had received them. According to the settings I should be receiving all notifications, but nothing. Again, this is only for Android.\",\n",
       "  \"The video chat apparently keeps freezing on the other end of the chat, so I can see both myself and other user still moving, but I'm frozen on their screen. No matter what phone they use, iPhone or Android. Although, this is a new phone, pixel 4. The video chat features were not an issue on the pixel 2. I may include another star if this issue gets fixed\"],\n",
